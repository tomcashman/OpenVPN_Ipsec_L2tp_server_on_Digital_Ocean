### <a name="create-keys"></a>Create SSH Keys on client computer

Check for existing SSH keys

```bash
ls -al ~/.ssh
```

Generate new SSH key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C your_email@example.com
```

Public key is now located in `/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Private key is now located in `/home/demo/.ssh/id_rsa`. While creating new droplet, add these keys.

### <a name="new-login"></a>Login after creating droplet

Login as root

```bash
ssh root@server_ip_address
```

Upgrade system

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
```

Create new user

```bash
adduser demo
```

Give root privileges

```bash
gpasswd -a demo sudo
```

Add public key authentication for new user using client computer. Call new public key id_rsa_demo

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C your_email@example.com
```

Copy contents of public key by `CTRL-C` or `(cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa_demo.pub)`

Manually install public key on server

```bash
su - demo
mkdir .ssh
chmod 700 .ssh
```

Paste in public key while in nano

```bash
sudo nano .ssh/authorized_keys

chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys
```

Exit returns to root

```bash
exit
```

Login as new user

###<a name="disable-root"></a>Disable root login and change SSH port

It is possible to change SSH port to anything you like as long as it doesn't conflict with other active ports. Port 22 is written below, but any port can be used. **Allow new port in ufw rules below and restart ufw before restarting ssh**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Port 22
PermitRootLogin without-password
reload ssh
sudo restart ssh
```

### <a name="enable-ufw"></a>Enable UFW
    
```bash    
ufw limit 22
ufw allow 1194/udp
ufw allow 500/udp
ufw allow 4500/udp
```

Change from DROP to ACCEPT

```bash
sudo nano /etc/default/ufw

DEFAULT_FORWARD_POLICY="ACCEPT"
```

Add these lines to the before.rules file

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ufw/before.rules

# START OPENVPN RULES
# NAT table rules
*nat
:POSTROUTING ACCEPT [0:0]
# Allow traffic from OpenVPN client to eth0
-A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/8 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
COMMIT
# END OPENVPN RULES
```

UFW rules should look similar to this

```bash
#Status: active
#Logging: on (low)
#Default: deny (incoming), allow (outgoing), allow (routed)
#New profiles: skip

#To                         Action      From
#--                         ------      ----
#22                         LIMIT IN    Anywhere
#1194/udp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
#500/udp                    ALLOW IN    Anywhere
#4500/udp                   ALLOW IN    Anywhere
#1194/udp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
#22 (v6)                    LIMIT IN    Anywhere (v6)
#500/udp (v6)               ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
#4500/udp (v6)              ALLOW IN    Anywhere (v6)
```

### <a name="install-ovpn"></a>Install OpenVPN

```bash
#https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install
```

```bash    
wget git.io/vpn --no-check-certificate -O openvpn-install.sh && bash openvpn-install.sh
```

Copy unified .ovpn to client computer

```bash
scp -P root@server_ip_address:client.ovpn Downloads/
```

### <a name="install-libreswan"></a>Install Libreswan

```bash
#https://blog.ls20.com/ipsec-l2tp-vpn-auto-setup-for-ubuntu-12-04-on-amazon-ec2/
#https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn
```

```bash
wget https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn/raw/master/vpnsetup.sh -O vpnsetup.sh
```

```bash
sudo nano -w vpnsetup.sh

PSK:your_private_key
Username:your_username
Password:your_password
```

```bash
/bin/sh vpnsetup.sh
```

Run following commands if OpenVPN doesn't work after reboot

```bash
sudo iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 1194 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -s 10.8.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -I FORWARD -m state --state RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
sudo service ufw stop
sudo service ufw start
sudo /etc/init.d/openvpn restart
```

Enable Iptables persistence so above commands should no longer be needed

```bash
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables.rules
```

Insert these lines in /etc/rc.local:

```bash
iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.rules
```

### <a name="dnsmasq"></a>Install Dnsmasq

Check current nameserver configuration

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Install Dnsmasq

```bash
sudo apt-get install dnsmasq
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

Take note of query time

```bash
dig digitalocean.com @localhost
```

Check again after cached

```bash
dig digitalocean.com @localhost
```

### <a name="ntp"></a>Install NTP

```bash
sudo apt-get install ntp
```

```bash
sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata
sudo ntpdate pool.ntp.org

From: myemailaddress@gmail.com
Subject: test email

hello world!
```

Note the blank line after the subject, everything after this line is the body of the email. When you're finished, press Ctrl-D. sSMTP may take a few seconds to send the message before closing.

### <a name="upgrades"></a>Enable Automatic Upgrades

```bash
sudo apt-get install unattended-upgrades
sudo dpkg-reconfigure unattended-upgrades
```

Update the 10 periodic file. "1" means that it will upgrade every day

```bash
/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/10periodic
```

```bash
APT::Periodic::Update-Package-Lists "1";
APT::Periodic::Download-Upgradeable-Packages "1";
APT::Periodic::AutocleanInterval "7";

# "ignoreip" can be an IP address, a CIDR mask or a DNS host
ignoreip = 127.0.0.⅛
bantime  = 600
maxretry = 3
```

Setup ssmtp settings with following settings

```bash
destemail = your_email@example.com
sendername = Fail2Ban
mta = sendmail
#_mwl sends email with logs
action = %(action_mwl)s
```

Jails we can initially set to true without any errors

```bash
#ssh
#dropbear
#pam-generic
#ssh-ddos
#postfix
#couriersmtp
#courierauth
#sasl
#dovecot
```

Restart fail2ban

```bash
sudo service fail2ban stop
sudo service fail2ban start
```

Check list of banned IP for fail2ban

```bash
fail2ban-client status ssh
iptables --list -n | fgrep DROP
```

###Full system backup using rsync.

Using the -aAX set of options, all attributes are preserved

```bash
rsync -aAXv --exclude={"/dev/*","/proc/*","/sys/*","/tmp/*","/run/*","/mnt/*","/media/*","/lost+found"} root@your_hostname:/ /home/demo/backup/
```

### <a name="tripwire"></a>Configure TripWire

```bash
#https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-tripwire-to-detect-server-intrusions-on-an-ubuntu-vps
```

```bash
sudo apt-get install tripwire
```

Set the Site-Key passphrase and the Local-Key passphrase

Create policy file

```bash
sudo twadmin --create-polfile /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
```

Initialize database

```bash
sudo tripwire --init
sudo sh -c 'tripwire --check | grep Filename > /etc/tripwire/test_results'
```

Entries may look like this:

```bash
less /etc/tripwire/test_results
```

```bash
     Filename: /etc/rc.boot
     Filename: /root/mail
     Filename: /root/Mail
     Filename: /root/.xsession-errors
     Filename: /root/.xauth
     Filename: /root/.tcshrc
     Filename: /root/.sawfish
     Filename: /root/.pinerc
     Filename: /root/.mc
     Filename: /root/.gnome_private
     Filename: /root/.gnome-desktop
     Filename: /root/.gnome
     Filename: /root/.esd_auth
     Filename: /root/.elm
     Filename: /root/.cshrc
     Filename: /root/.bash_profile
     Filename: /root/.bash_logout
     Filename: /root/.amandahosts
     Filename: /root/.addressbook.lu
     Filename: /root/.addressbook
     Filename: /root/.Xresources
     Filename: /root/.Xauthority
     Filename: /root/.ICEauthority
     Filename: /proc/30400/fd/3
     Filename: /proc/30400/fdinfo/3
     Filename: /proc/30400/task/30400/fd/3
     Filename: /proc/30400/task/30400/fdinfo/3
```

Edit text policy in editor

```bash
sudo nano /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
```

Search for each of the files that were returned in the test_results file. Comment out lines that match.

```bash
    {
        /dev                    -> $(Device) ;
        /dev/pts                -> $(Device) ;
        #/proc                  -> $(Device) ;
        /proc/devices           -> $(Device) ;
        /proc/net               -> $(Device) ;
        /proc/tty               -> $(Device) ;
        . . .
```

Comment out /var/run and /var/lock lines so that system does not flag normal filesystem changes by services:

```bash
    (
  rulename = "System boot changes",
  severity = $(SIG_HI)
    )
    {
        #/var/lock              -> $(SEC_CONFIG) ;
        #/var/run               -> $(SEC_CONFIG) ; # daemon PIDs
        /var/log                -> $(SEC_CONFIG) ;
    }
```

Save and close

Implement by re-creating encrypted policy file that tripwire reads

```bash
sudo twadmin -m P /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
```

Reinitialize the database to implement policy

```bash
sudo tripwire --init
```

Warnings should be gone. If there are still warnings, continue editing /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt file until gone.

The basic syntax for a check is

```bash
sudo tripwire --check
```

Delete the test_results file that we created

```bash 
sudo rm /etc/tripwire/test_results
```
Remove plain text configuration files

```bash    
sudo sh -c 'twadmin --print-polfile > /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt'
```

Move text version to backup location and recreate it

```bash
sudo mv /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt.bak
sudo sh -c 'twadmin --print-polfile > /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt'
```

Remove plain text files

```bash
sudo rm /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt
sudo rm /etc/tripwire/twpol.txt.bak
```

Send an email notifications

```bash
sudo apt-get install mailutils
```

See if we can send email

```bash
sudo tripwire --check | mail -s "Tripwire report for `uname -n`" your_email@example.com
```

Check report that was sent with the email

```bash
sudo tripwire --check --interactive
```

Remove “x” from box if not ok with change

Automate Tripwire with Cron

Check to see if root already has a crontab by issuing this command:

```bash
sudo crontab -l
```

If a crontab is present, you should pipe it into a file to back it up:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'crontab -l > crontab.bad'
```

Afterwards, we can edit the crontab by typing:

```bash
sudo crontab -e
```

To have tripwire run at 3:30am every day, we can place a line like this in our file:

```bash
30 3 * * * /usr/sbin/tripwire --check | mail -s "Tripwire report for `uname -n`" your_email@example.com
```
